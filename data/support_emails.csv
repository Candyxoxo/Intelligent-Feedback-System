Can you help troubleshoot this sync issue?",user6@example.com,2025-06-27 01:51:21,Medium
E007,Feature Request: Dark Mode,"Would it be possible to add a dark mode theme? I use your app frequently during late hours and the current bright interface is quite harsh on the eyes.

Thanks for considering this feature request!",user7@example.com,2025-07-04 14:51:21,Medium
E008,Suggestion for Improvement,"I love using your app but have a suggestion that could improve user experience. The search function could be more intuitive - maybe add filters by date, type, or tags? Also, keyboard shortcuts for common actions would speed up workflow significantly. Just some ideas from a daily user. Overall, great product!",user8@example.com,2025-07-11 03:51:21,Medium
E009,Login Issue,"Hi, I'm locked out of my account. When I try to log in, it says 'invalid credentials' but I'm 100% sure my password is correct. I use a password manager so there's no typing error. This started happening after the recent app update. Could there be a bug with the authentication system? Need access urgently for work.",user9@example.com,2025-06-18 13:51:21,Low
E010,Data Loss Problem,"URGENT: I've lost a critical project file that I was working on for the past month. The file was definitely saved (I always save frequently) but now it's completely gone from my project list. This represents weeks of work and I have a client deadline tomorrow.

Sometimes it crashes 3-4 times per hour which makes it very frustrating to use. I've cleared cache, updated to latest version, but problem continues. Device has plenty of storage and RAM available.",user11@example.com,2025-07-05 09:52:28,Medium
E012,Feature Request: Dark Mode,"Hi team, could you please consider implementing a dark mode? Many users would appreciate this feature, especially those of us who work in low-light environments or have visual sensitivities. It's become pretty standard in modern apps. Even a simple toggle in settings would be perfect. Thanks for all your hard work on this app!",user12@example.com,2025-06-26 05:52:28,Low
E013,Data Loss Problem,"I'm missing several files that were definitely in my account last week. They seem to have disappeared after the recent system maintenance.

E015,Suggestion for Improvement,"I have some ideas that might enhance the user experience: 1) Add bulk actions for managing multiple items at once, 2) Implement drag-and-drop functionality for organizing content, 3) Add a recent activity log so users can see what they worked on recently. These features would really streamline my workflow. Keep up the excellent work!",user15@example.com,2025-07-14 03:52:28,Medium
E016,Suggestion for Improvement,"The notification system could use some improvements. Currently, I get too many notifications for minor things, but I'd like more detailed notifications for important events. Could you add notification preferences where users can customize what types of alerts they receive? Also, email digest options would be helpful for less urgent updates.",user16@example.com,2025-07-08 05:52:28,Medium
E017,Suggestion for Improvement,"Love the app overall! One feature that would be amazing is offline mode support. Sometimes I work in areas with poor internet connection and would love to continue working offline with sync happening automatically when connection is restored. This would make the app much more versatile for mobile workers like myself.",user17@example.com,2025-07-19 04:52:28,Low

Running on MacBook Pro M2.",user19@example.com,2025-06-11 15:52:28,Medium

Please help recover this data urgently.",user20@example.com,2025-06-21 21:52:28,Medium
E021,Suggestion for Improvement,"The mobile app could benefit from better tablet optimization. On my iPad, the interface feels cramped and doesn't take advantage of the larger screen space.

E022,Feature Request: Dark Mode,"Hi! I'm writing to request a dark mode feature. I use your app extensively during evening hours and the bright interface causes eye strain.

E025,Suggestion for Improvement,"I'd love to see better integration with third-party tools like Slack, Trello, and Google Workspace. Currently, I have to manually copy information between platforms.

Can you please clarify what's happening with my account?",user26@example.com,2025-07-17 22:52:28,Medium
E027,Feature Request: Dark Mode,"Please add dark mode! As a developer who stares at screens all day, the bright white interface is really tough on my eyes, especially when switching between your app and my dark-themed code editor.

E028,Suggestion for Improvement,"The search functionality needs improvement. Results aren't very relevant and there's no way to sort or filter them effectively. Also, search doesn't seem to look inside document content, only titles. For users with large amounts of data, better search is crucial for productivity. Consider implementing full-text search with advanced filters.",user28@example.com,2025-06-19 11:52:28,Medium
E029,Suggestion for Improvement,"Would love to see version history for documents, similar to Google Docs. Sometimes I need to revert changes or see what was modified and when. Currently, there's no way to track document evolution or collaborate effectively with change tracking.

E030,App Crash Report,"Consistent crashes when using the app on my older Android device (Android 10). The app loads fine initially but crashes within 5-10 minutes of use. I understand older devices may have limitations, but the app worked fine until the recent update.

Please check what happened and help restore my current data state.",user31@example.com,2025-06-14 20:52:28,Low
E032,Suggestion for Improvement,"The user interface could be more intuitive for new users. I've had several colleagues try the app but they found it confusing initially.

When I work on the same project from different devices, changes sometimes overwrite each other instead of merging properly. Lost several hours of work this way.

E034,Suggestion for Improvement,"Performance has been sluggish lately, especially with larger projects. Loading times have increased significantly and the app sometimes becomes unresponsive for 10-15 seconds. This wasn't an issue before the recent updates. Please optimize performance for users with substantial amounts of data. Otherwise, love the new features you've been adding!",user34@example.com,2025-06-26 21:52:28,High
E035,Suggestion for Improvement,"Collaboration features need enhancement. Currently, there's no real-time editing or proper commenting system. For team projects, we need to see who's working on what and communicate directly within the app. Think Google Docs-style collaboration but for your platform. This would make the app much more valuable for business teams.",user35@example.com,2025-06-21 17:52:28,Medium

Can you manually reset my password?",user37@example.com,2025-06-27 15:52:28,Medium
E038,Suggestion for Improvement,"Mobile app needs landscape mode support and better tablet optimization. Currently, it's clearly designed for phones and doesn't utilize larger screens effectively. For users who primarily work on tablets, this makes the app less practical. Also, consider adding stylus support for devices that have them.",user38@example.com,2025-06-12 04:52:28,Medium
E039,Login Issue,"Account keeps getting automatically logged out every few minutes, even when I'm actively using the app. I have to re-enter credentials constantly which is very disruptive to workflow.

E040,Data Loss Problem,"Critical data corruption issue: Several of my most important files are showing corrupted data when opened.
